//Memory efficiency - how much does it use in RAM (bit or byte wise). --> Very simple once you understand it. You can use memory complexity for that.
//Compute efficiency - how long does it take to run in the CPU. --> time complexity.
//GPU efficiency - How quickly can you execute in the gpu. --> time complexity.
//GPU Memory efficiency - how much VRAM does it take in the GPU. --> Memory complexity.
